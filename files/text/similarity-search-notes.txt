Dot Product Search


* Measures the similarity between two vectors by computing the dot product of the two vectors. 
* The dot product measures the angle between the vectors. 
* If the vectors are pointing in similar directions (i.e., have a small angle between them), the dot product will be large, indicating high similarity. 
* If the vectors are pointing in dissimilar directions, the dot product will be small, indicating low similarity.


Cosine Similarity Search


* It measures the angle between two vectors but is more robust to differences in vector magnitudes. 
* Calculated by taking the dot product of the two vectors and dividing it by the product of their magnitudes. 
* The resulting value ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect similarity, -1 indicates perfect dissimilarity, and 0 indicates orthogonality (no similarity). 
* Widely used in information retrieval, text mining, and collaborative filtering applications.


FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)


* Efficient similarity search library developed by Facebook AI Research. 
* Designed to perform similarity searches on large-scale datasets with millions or billions of vectors efficiently. 
* Employs specialized algorithms, such as the Product Quantization (PQ) and Inverted File techniques, to speed up similarity search operations.
* Commonly used in tasks like image retrieval, text search, and recommendation systems.


The choice of similarity metric or library depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data and the scale of the similarity search task.


* Dot Product Similarity uses the dot product of vectors
* Cosine Similarity uses the angle between vectors
* FAISS is a library that provides efficient algorithms for similarity search on large datasets.
